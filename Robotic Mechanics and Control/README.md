# Robotic Mechanics and Control


In this  course  learned  the  basic  background  on  Robotics  and Manipulators. The main goal is to cover kinematics and dynamics of manipulators  in  the  first  part  of  the  course.  Then,  in  the  second  part  of  the course,  we  concentrate  on  control  methods  for  manipulators  to  achieve stabilization  and  desired performance.
